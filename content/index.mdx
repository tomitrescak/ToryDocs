Since the first version of React that I worked with (`0.2.3`), the platform, the tooling, licensing and a community has come a long way. But what is consistent since the very first version and the best feature of React is the approach it teaches you to build robust and scalable applications known as *component driven development*. Separating applications into dedicated, lean and pure components / functions, provides multitude of benefits, best described on [HiChroma blog](https://blog.hichroma.com/component-driven-development-ce1109d56c8e). 

There are several existing tools that help you develop, test and maintain component in isolation. Among the most popular are [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) and [Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos).

While all the previously mentioned platforms are rather passive (they do not enter into active web development and rather serve the purpose of catalogues), there are more active visual tools that allow us to use React components in live development, for example [Framer](https://framer.com).

**Tory.js** stands in the middle of this landscape and aims to serve several purposes. While you can use it passively as a component catalogue, you can also use as a visual application and form designer similar to Framer X, working with live or fake data point. **It runs natively in the browser** and as a result you can embed the editor directly it in your application. Behold the editor in action.

## Disclaimer

In the current state the form part of the Tory.js project is quite stable, but editor may contain bugs. I do not recommend to use this project in production in large project yet as the project will need to be stabilised first. The documentation is quite complete, but it needs some work, mainly in the definition of API and provision of some examples.

## The Philosophy

The *component-driven development* facilitates the application development and maintenance. The main problem of this approach is the estimation of granularity of your component stack, meaning: "Is a current functionality worth separating into a component?". If the breakdown is not done properly, we can either end up with few, very complex, fragile and hard to maintain components, or we end up with many small components, intertwined into fragile, complex structures.

Moreover, we love rapid prototyping and design centric approaches, where visual representation of your app can be easily separated from data backend. Yet, we understand the importance of knowing and understanding the domain in which the application will function and the complex procedures that are necessary to adjust your application when the domain specification changes. As a result, we designed the Tory.js with simple modification strategies for changing your domain shape as well as powerful methods to fake your data backend to rapidly develop and prototype front end structure.

## Lean and blazing fast ðŸš€

Tory.js is optimised for tree shaking and as a result when combined with efficient bundling strategies it reduces the bundle size to only necessary functionality from Tory.js. **The core packages of Tory.js total only 17kb (gzip)**. The total size of bundled [starter application](https://github.com/tomitrescak/toryjs) is a very pleasant **190kb** including all packages (React, mobx, ajv ...). The editor is on a heavier size, packing around *60kb* in core and other *50kb* in dependencies.

## The Technology Stack

Tory.js is primarily aimed at React users, yet the technology selected is framework agnostic. 

### Back End

It connects to various back-ends. Currently we support native `fetch` operation to query `json` APIs as well as [GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com) end points using [Apollo queries and mutations](components/apollo).

### Application State

      Mobx State Tree</a>

  </table>

In Tory.js we relate to the application  form state as to **dataset**. The dataset is modeled and stored using the latest [JSON Schema, draft-07](https://json-schema.org) standard. It defines robust validations for all javascript types, including conditional validations. We use [ajv](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv), the fastest and most robust schema validator to bring you the best experience.

Using @toryjs/form package, we transform the json schema to a mobx-state-tree to provide reactive updates and the two-way data binding with your form components. Currently we support a bigger part of the draft-07 standard.

### Front End

The front-end is build with and aimed at React.js users. 
Possibly, if this project will get enough traction, we would like to support other front end frameworks
such as Angular, VueJS or Web Components.
